# Finding Words In Matrix

This challenge propose a matrix such as:

{'A', 'B', 'R'}

{'C', 'Y', 'P'}

{'H', 'U', 'L'}

given an array of words, we must return the words that can be put togteher in the matrix following the next simple rules:

- a letter can only follow the previuos letter if it's on the immediate right, left, top or bottom of the previous letter, for exmaple, letter Y can only be followed by letters P,U,C & B. letter A can only be followed by letter B & C, note that this forms a cross pattern for the allowed letters to form a word
